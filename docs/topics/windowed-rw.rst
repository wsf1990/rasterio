Windowed reading and writing
============================

Beginning in rasterio 0.3, you can read and write "windows" of raster files.
This feature allows you to work on rasters that are larger than your
computers RAM or process chunks of large rasters in parallel.

Windows
-------

A window is a view onto a rectangular subset of a raster dataset and is
described in rasterio by column and row offsets and width and height
in pixels. These may be ints or floats.

.. code-block:: python

   Window(col_off, row_off, width, height)

Windows may also be constructed from numpy array index tuples or slice objects.
Only int values are permitted in these cases.

.. code-block:: python

   Window.from_slices((row_start, row_stop), (col_start, col_stop))
   Window.from_slices(slice(row_start, row_stop), slice(col_start, col_stop))

If height and width keyword arguments are passed to ``from_slices``, relative
and open-ended slices may be used.

.. code-block:: python

   Window.from_slices(slice(None), slice(None), height=100, width=100)
   # Window(col_off=0.0, row_off=0.0, width=100.0, height=100.0)

   Window.from_slices(slice(10, -10), slice(10, -10), height=100, width=100)
   # Window(col_off=10, row_off=10, width=80, height=80)

Reading
-------

Here is an example of reading a 256 row x 512 column subset of the rasterio
test file.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import rasterio
    >>> with rasterio.open('tests/data/RGB.byte.tif') as src:
    ...     w = src.read(1, window=Window(0, 0, 512, 256))
    ...
    >>> print(w.shape)
    (256, 512)

Writing
-------

Writing works similarly. The following creates a blank 500 column x 300 row
GeoTIFF and plops 37,500 pixels with value 127 into a window 30 pixels down from
and 50 pixels to the right of the upper left corner of the GeoTIFF.

.. code-block:: python

    image = numpy.ones((150, 250), dtype=rasterio.ubyte) * 127

    with rasterio.open(
            '/tmp/example.tif', 'w',
            driver='GTiff', width=500, height=300, count=1,
            dtype=image.dtype) as dst:
        dst.write(image, window=Window(50, 30, 250, 150), indexes=1)

The result:

.. image:: http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5503/11378078386_cbe2fde02e_o_d.png
   :width: 500
   :height: 300

Decimation
----------

If the write window is smaller than the data, the data will be decimated.
Below, the window is scaled to one third of the source image.

.. code-block:: python

    with rasterio.open('tests/data/RGB.byte.tif') as src:
        b, g, r = (src.read(k) for k in (1, 2, 3))
    # src.height = 718, src.width = 791

    write_window = Window.from_slices((30, 269), (50, 313))
    # write_window.height = 239, write_window.width = 263

    with rasterio.open(
            '/tmp/example.tif', 'w',
            driver='GTiff', width=500, height=300, count=3,
            dtype=r.dtype) as dst:
        for k, arr in [(1, b), (2, g), (3, r)]:
            dst.write(arr, indexes=k, window=write_window)

And the result:

.. image:: http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3804/11378361126_c034743079_o_d.png
   :width: 500
   :height: 300

Data windows
------------

Sometimes it is desirable to crop off an outer boundary of NODATA values around
a dataset:

.. code-block:: python

    from rasterio.windows import get_data_window

    with rasterio.open('tests/data/RGB.byte.tif') as src:
        window = get_data_window(src.read(1, masked=True))
        # window = Window(col_off=13, row_off=3, width=757, height=711)

        kwargs = src.meta.copy()
        kwargs.update({
            'height': window.height,
            'width': window.width,
            'transform': rasterio.windows.transform(window, src.transform)})

        with rasterio.open('/tmp/cropped.tif', 'w', **kwargs) as dst:
            dst.write(src.read(window=window))

Window transforms
-----------------

The affine transform of a window can be accessed using a dataset's
``window_transform`` method:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import rasterio
    >>> from rasterio.windows import Window
    >>> win = Window(256, 256, 128, 128)
    >>> with rasterio.open('tests/data/RGB.byte.tif') as src:
    ...     src_transform = src.transform
    ...     win_transform = src.window_transform(win)
    ...
    >>> print(src_transform)
    | 300.04, 0.00, 101985.00|
    | 0.00,-300.04, 2826915.00|
    | 0.00, 0.00, 1.00|
    >>> print(win_transform)
    | 300.04, 0.00, 178794.71|
    | 0.00,-300.04, 2750104.30|
    | 0.00, 0.00, 1.00|

Window utilities
----------------

Basic union and intersection operations are available for windows, to
streamline operations across dynamically created windows for a series of bands
or datasets with the same full extent.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from rasterio import windows
    >>> # Full window is ((0, 1000), (0, 500))
    >>> window1 = Window(10, 100, 490, 400)
    >>> window2 = Window(50, 10, 200, 140)
    >>> windows.union(window1, window2)
    Window(col_off=10, row_off=10, width=490, height=490)
    >>> windows.intersection(window1, window2)
    Window(col_off=50, row_off=100, width=200, height=50)


Blocks
------

Raster datasets are generally composed of multiple blocks of data and
windowed reads and writes are most efficient when the windows match the
dataset's own block structure. When a file is opened to read, the shape
of blocks for any band can be had from the block_shapes property.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> with rasterio.open('tests/data/RGB.byte.tif') as src:
    ...     for i, shape in enumerate(src.block_shapes, 1):
    ...         print((i, shape))
    ...
    (1, (3, 791))
    (2, (3, 791))
    (3, (3, 791))


The block windows themselves can be had from the block_windows function.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> with rasterio.open('tests/data/RGB.byte.tif') as src:
    ...     for ji, window in src.block_windows(1):
    ...         print((ji, window))
    ...
    ((0, 0), ((0, 3), (0, 791)))
    ((1, 0), ((3, 6), (0, 791)))
    ...

This function returns an iterator that yields a pair of values. The second is
a window tuple that can be used in calls to `read` or `write`. The first
is the pair of row and column indexes of this block within all blocks of the
dataset.

You may read windows of data from a file block-by-block like this.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> with rasterio.open('tests/data/RGB.byte.tif') as src:
    ...     for ji, window in src.block_windows(1):
    ...         r = src.read(1, window=window)
    ...         print(r.shape)
    ...         break
    ...
    (3, 791)

Well-bred files have identically blocked bands, but GDAL allows otherwise and
it's a good idea to test this assumption in your code.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> with rasterio.open('tests/data/RGB.byte.tif') as src:
    ...     assert len(set(src.block_shapes)) == 1
    ...     for ji, window in src.block_windows(1):
    ...         b, g, r = (src.read(k, window=window) for k in (1, 2, 3))
    ...         print((ji, r.shape, g.shape, b.shape))
    ...         break
    ...
    ((0, 0), (3, 791), (3, 791), (3, 791))

The block_shapes property is a band-ordered list of block shapes and
`set(src.block_shapes)` gives you the set of unique shapes. Asserting that
there is only one item in the set is effectively the same as asserting that all
bands have the same block structure. If they do, you can use the same windows
for each.
