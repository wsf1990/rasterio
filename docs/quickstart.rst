Python Quickstart
=================

Reading and writing data files is a spatial data analyst's bread and butter.
This document explains how to use Rasterio to read existing files and to create
new files. Some advanced topics are glossed over to be covered in more detail
elsewhere in Rasterio's documentation. Only the GeoTIFF format is used here,
but the examples do apply to other raster data formats. It is presumed that
Rasterio has been `installed <./installation>`__.

Opening a dataset in reading mode
---------------------------------

Consider an "example.tif" file with 16-bit Landsat 8 imagery covering a part
of the United States's Colorado Plateau [#]_. Because the imagery is large (70
MB) and has a wide dynamic range it is difficult to display it in a browser.
A rescaled and dynamically squashed version is shown below.

.. image:: img/example.png

Import rasterio to begin.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import rasterio

Next, open the file.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset = rasterio.open('example.tif')

Rasterio's ``rasterio.open()`` takes a path and returns a dataset object. The
path may point to a file of any supported raster format. Rasterio will open it
using the proper GDAL format driver. Dataset objects have some of the same
attributes as Python file objects.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset.name
    'example.tif'
    >>> dataset.mode
    'r'
    >>> dataset.closed
    False

Dataset attributes
------------------

Properties of the raster data stored in "example.tif" can be accessed through
attributes of the ``dataset`` object. Dataset objects have bands and this
example has a band count of 1.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset.count
    1

A dataset band is an array of values representing the partial distribution of
a single variable in 2-dimensional (2D) space. All band arrays of a dataset
have the same number of rows and columns. The variable represented by the
example dataset's sole band is Level-1 digital numbers (DN) for the Landsat
8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) band 4 (wavelengths between 640-670
nanometers). These values can be scaled to radiance or reflectance values. The
array of DN values has 7731 columns (its ``width``) and
7871 rows (its ``height``).

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset.width
    7731
    >>> dataset.height
    7871

Some dataset attributes expose the properties of all dataset bands via a tuple
of values, one per band. To get a mapping of band indexes to variable data
types, apply a dictionary comprehension to the ``zip()`` product of a dataset's
``indexes`` and ``dtypes`` attributes.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> {i: dtype for i, dtype in zip(dataset.indexes, dataset.dtypes)}
    {1: 'uint16'}

The "example.tif" file's sole band contains unsigned 16-bit integer values. The
GeoTIFF format also supports signed integers and floats of different size.

Dataset georeferencing
----------------------

A GIS raster dataset is different from an ordinary image; its elements (or
"pixels") are mapped to regions on the earth's surface. Every pixels of a
dataset is contained within a spatial bounding box.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset.bounds
    BoundingBox(left=358485.0, bottom=4028985.0, right=590415.0, top=4265115.0)

Our example covers the world from
358485 meters (in this case) to 590415 meters, left to right, and 4028985
meters to 4265115 meters bottom to top. It covers a region 231.93 kilometers
wide by 236.13 kilometers high.

The ``bounds`` attribute is derived from a more fundamental attribute: the
dataset's geospatial ``transform``.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset.transform
    Affine(30.0, 0.0, 358485.0,
           0.0, -30.0, 4265115.0)

The ``transform`` attribute is an affine transformation matrix that maps pixel
locations in (row, col) coordinates to (x, y) spatial positions. The product of
this matrix and ``(0, 0)``, the row and column coordinates of the upper left
corner of the dataset, is the spatial position of the upper left corner.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset.transform * (0, 0)
    (358485.0, 4265115.0)

The position of the lower right corner is obtained similarly.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset.transform * (dataset.width, dataset.height)
    (590415.0, 4028985.0)

But what do these numbers mean? 4028985 meters from where? These coordinate
values are relative to the origin of the dataset's coordinate reference system
(CRS).

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset.crs
    CRS({'init': 'epsg:32612'})

"epsg:32612" identifies a particular coordinate reference system: `UTM
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system>`__
zone 12N.  This system is used for mapping areas in the Northern Hemisphere
between 108 and 114 degrees west. The upper left corner of the example dataset,
``(358485.0, 4265115.0)``, is 141.5 kilometers west of zone 12's central
meridian (111 degrees west) and 4265 kilometers north of the equator.

Coordinate reference systems are an advanced topic. Suffice it to say that
between the ``crs`` attribute and the ``transform`` attribute a raster dataset
is geo-referenced and can be compared to other GIS datasets.

Reading raster data
-------------------

The raster array for a raster band can be accessed by calling
``dataset.read()`` with the band's index number. Following the GDAL convention,
bands are indexed from 1.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset.indexes
    (1,)
    >>> band1 = dataset.read(1)

The ``read()`` method returns a Numpy N-D array.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> band1
    array([[0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],
           ...,
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0]], dtype=uint16)

Values from the array can be had by their row, column index.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> band1[dataset.height // 2, dataset.width // 2]
    17491

Spatial indexing
----------------

Datasets have a method of getting array indices for spatial points. To get the
value for the pixel 100 kilometers east and 50 kilometers south of the
dataset's upper left corner, do the following.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> x, y = (dataset.bounds.left + 100000, dataset.bounds.top - 50000)
    >>> row, col = dataset.index(x, y)
    >>> row, col
    (1666, 3333)
    >>> band1[row, col]
    7566

To get the spatial coordinates of a pixel, use the dataset's ``xy()`` method.
The coordinates of the center of the image can be computed like this.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> dataset.xy(dataset.height // 2, dataset.width // 2)
    (476550.0, 4149150.0)

Creating data
-------------

Reading data is only half the story. Using Rasterio dataset objects, arrays of
values can be written to a raster data file and thus shared with other GIS
applications such as QGIS.

As an example, consider an array of floating point values representing, e.g.,
a temperature or pressure anomaly field measured or modeled on a regular grid,
240 columns by 180 rows. The first and last grid points on the horizontal axis
are located at 4.0 degrees west and 4.0 degrees east longitude, the first and
last grid points on the vertical axis are located at 3 degrees south and
3 degrees north latitude.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x = np.linspace(-4.0, 4.0, 240)
    >>> y = np.linspace(-3.0, 3.0, 180)
    >>> X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    >>> Z1 = np.exp(-2 * np.log(2) * ((X - 0.5) ** 2 + (Y - 0.5) ** 2) / 1 ** 2)
    >>> Z2 = np.exp(-3 * np.log(2) * ((X + 0.5) ** 2 + (Y + 0.5) ** 2) / 2.5 ** 2)
    >>> Z = 10.0 * (Z2 - Z1)

The fictional field for this example consists of the difference of two Gaussian
distributions and is represented by the array ``Z``. Its contours are shown
below.

.. image:: img/field.png


Opening a dataset in writing mode
---------------------------------

To save this array along with georeferencing information to a new raster data
file, call ``rasterio.open()`` with a path to the new file to be created,
``'w'`` to specify writing mode, and several keyword arguments.

* ``driver``: the name of the desired format driver
* ``width``: the number of columns of the dataset
* ``height``: the number of rows of the dataset
* ``count``: a count of the dataset bands
* ``dtype``: the data type of the dataset
* ``crs``: a coordinate reference system identifier or description
* ``transform``: an affine transformation matrix, and
* ``nodata``: a "nodata" value

The first 5 of these keyword arguments parametrize fixed, format-specific
properties of the data file and are required when opening a file to 
write. The last 3 are optional.

In this example the coordinate reference system will be "+proj=latlong", which
describes an equirectangular coordinate reference system with units of decimal
degrees. The right affine transformation matrix can be computed using
a function in the ``rasterio.transform`` module.

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> from rasterio.transform import from_origin
   >>> res = (x[-1] - x[0]) / 240.0
   >>> transform = from_origin(x[0] - res / 2, y[-1] + res / 2, res, res)
   >>> transform
   Affine(0.033333333333333333, 0.0, -4.0166666666666666,
          0.0, -0.033333333333333333, 3.0166666666666666)

The upper left point in the example grid is at 3 degrees west and 2 degrees
north. The raster pixel centered on this grid point extends ``res / 2``, or
1/60 degrees, in each direction, hence the shift in the expression above.

A dataset for storing the example grid is opened like so

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> new_dataset = rasterio.open('/tmp/new.tif', 'w', driver='GTiff',
    ...                             height=Z.shape[0], width=Z.shape[1],
    ...                             count=1, dtype=Z.dtype,
    ...                             crs='+proj=latlong', transform=transform)

Values for the `height`, `width`, and `dtype` keyword arguments are taken
directly from attributes of the 2-D array, ``Z``. Not all raster formats can
support the 64-bit float values in ``Z``, but the GeoTIFF format can.

Saving raster data
------------------

To save the grid, call the new dataset's ``write()`` method with the grid and
target band number as arguments.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> new_dataset.write(Z, 1)

and then call the ``close()`` method to sync data to disk and finish.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> new_dataset.close()

Because Rasterio's dataset objects mimic Python's file objects and implement
Python's context manager protocol, it is possible to do the following instead.

.. code-block:: python

    with rasterio.open('/tmp/new.tif', 'w', driver='GTiff', height=Z.shape[0],
                       width=Z.shape[1], count=1, dtype=Z.dtype,
                       crs='+proj=latlong', transform=transform) as dst:
        dst.write(Z, 1)

These are the basics of reading and writing raster data files. More features
and examples are contained in the `advanced topics <topics>`__ section.

.. [#] "example.tif" is an alias for band 4 of Landsat scene
   LC80370342016194LGN00.
